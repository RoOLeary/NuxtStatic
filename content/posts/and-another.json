It's not all bad though, they were spared having to see their grown son wear a whistle. Why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry? Oh yeah you can't. They blew up. Well I don't like your unemployed genes in my grandchildren, Jerry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mind your own goddamn business, Gene! I'm having a conversation with my mother here! Kissing Rick's ass isn't gonna make him stay, Mom, but it will help you lose everyone else. He's not a hot girl. He can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's. Morty, I'm a drunk, not a hack. My man! </p>"
